You must reply with JSON formatted strictly according to the JSON specification in which all values are strings.

    ""annotated_text"": ""<The input text where each piece of information about this parameter is surrounded by curly braces. There should be no changes other than adding curly braces, even to whitespace. Leave this field empty in case of failure.>,""
    ""justification"": ""<Justification for your annotations in case of success or the reason why you were not able to find the parameter in case of failure.>""
}
