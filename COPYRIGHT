1. Each contributor retains the copyright to their individual contributions
to the project.

2. The project's versioning system is the sole method for recording all
individual contributions and the associated copyright details.

3. Specifying corporate affiliation or a work email with a commit shall
have no bearing on copyright ownership and does not constitute copyright
assignment to the employer.

4. Since individual contributions are often changes to the existing code,
copyright notices in project files must specify The Project Contributors
and never an individual copyright holder.

5. Submitting a contribution to this project constitutes your acceptance
of these terms.
